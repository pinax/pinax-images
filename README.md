## Pinax

[Pinax](http://pinaxproject.com/pinax/) is an open-source platform built on the
Django Web Framework. It is an ecosystem of reusable Django apps, themes, and
starter project templates.

This app is part of the Pinax ecosystem and is designed for use both with and
independently of other Pinax apps.


## pinax-images

## Getting Started and Documentation

### Quickstart

To install pinax-images:

    pip install pinax-images

Add `pinax.images` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        "pinax.images",
        ...
    )

`pinax-images`-specific settings can be found in the [Settings](#settings) section.

Add an entry to your `urls.py`:

    url(r"^ajax/images/", include("pinax.images.urls", namespace="pinax_images")),

Refer to [Usage](#usage) for adding image collection functionality to your application.


### Dependencies

* `django-appconf>=1.0.1`
* `django-imagekit>=3.2.7`
* `pilkit>=1.1.13`
* `pillow>=3.0`
* `pytz>=2015.6`


## Usage

First, add a `OneToOneField` on your content object to `ImageSet`::

    from pinax.images.models import ImageSet

    class YourModel():
        ...
        image_set = models.OneToOneField(ImageSet)
        ...

In your view for creating your content object, you should create a
new ImageSet for each new content object:

    class ObjectCreateView(CreateView):

        def form_valid(self, form):
            form.instance.image_set = ImageSet.objects.create(created_by=self.request.user)
            return super(CloudSpottingCreateView, self).form_valid(form)

Finally, you'll want to include a snippet like this wherever you want the image panel
to appear (if you are using the associated [pinax-images-panel](http://github.com/pinax/pinax-images-panel) ReactJS frontend):

    {% if image_set %}
        {% url "pinax_images:imageset_upload" image_set.pk as upload_url %}
    {% else %}
        {% url "pinax_images:imageset_new_upload" as upload_url %}
    {% endif %}
    <div id="image-panel" data-images-url="{% if image_set %}{% url "pinax_images:imageset_detail" image_set.pk %}{% endif %}"
                          data-upload-url="{{ upload_url }}"
                          data-image-set-id="{{ image_set.pk }}">
    </div>
    
    
## Settings

The following settings allow you to specify the behavior of `pinax-images` in
your project.

### Customizing Thumbnail Specs

By default `pinax-images` maintains four thumbnail specifications for thumbnail generation of uploaded images.
These specifications (shown below) are located in `pinax/images/specs.py`.

    PINAX_IMAGES_THUMBNAIL_SPEC = "pinax.images.specs.ImageThumbnail"
    PINAX_IMAGES_LIST_THUMBNAIL_SPEC = "pinax.images.specs.ImageListThumbnail"
    PINAX_IMAGES_SMALL_THUMBNAIL_SPEC = "pinax.images.specs.ImageSmallThumbnail"
    PINAX_IMAGES_MEDIUM_THUMBNAIL_SPEC = "pinax.images.specs.ImageMediumThumbnail"

You can customize thumbnailing options by creating your own specification class inheriting from `ImageSpec`:

    from imagekit import ImageSpec
    from pilkit.processors import ResizeToFit

    class MyCustomImageThumbnail(ImageSpec):
        processors = [ResizeToFit(800, 600)]
        format = "JPEG"
        options = {"quality": 90}

and overriding pinax-image specs in your application `settings.py`::

    PINAX_IMAGES_THUMBNAIL_SPEC = "{{my_app}}.specs.MyCustomImageThumbnail"
